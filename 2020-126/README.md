**Research Problem**

In day-today life, we come across different situations where we require to obtain immediate household renovations (Ex: Gardening, Plumbing, Painting,
Masonry, Electrical) and vehicle repair services, medical treatments, etc. There’s no certain standard mechanism available to obtain those services 
as soon as possible when the requirement is met. Sometimes it may take hours or days to fulfill those services in most of the rural areas and outside 
of city areas global wide. Even most of the people in modern society are employed as office workers rather than being a domestic helper, a technician 
etc. Therefore, it’s very difficult to find and reach out to those skilled workers in case of emergency.

**Main Objective**

It would be of great help to people if they knew the cost of a task before it was completed. As it is more convenient to use web and mobile application 
it was proposed to create an application that directly integrates clients and service providers. Through this application it is expected to provide 
consumers with a fast and a quality service and make day-to-day life easier

**Sub Objectives** 

•	Customer and service identification and comparison through a method of computing. 
•	Customer request will be analyzed and customer requirement will be identified by the system. According to the customer requirements system will 
    provide solutions. Customer will be able to find a service provider or online consultant though the system. 
•	Estimate payment on service providers produced works and provide a comparative rate for customers. 
•	When requesting a service provider one of the main thing that should be taken in to consideration is the cost for the service. It would be easy 
    for customers to get an awareness about the cost at first rather than after the task was done. Cost estimation system will provide customers with 
    this facility. 
•	Provide a customer response system for minor services.  
•	A real time service providing application would be much helpful when searching for minor services. Customers will be assisted by the allocation 
    of service providers. Rather than job posing application which were already developed customers would prefer a customer responsive system. 
•	Assist customers in finding the best service provider.

case of emergency. And also, there is no any mechanism to predict time and cost for a task, compare previous customer’s feedbacks which is mandatory 
when hiring service providers. 

Our program introduced helps the user to realize the cost of the service before completing it. The proposed system will overcome the drawbacks in the 
existing systems.

**Research problem**

In everyday life people get the need of minor services like fixing a broken pipe, change a flat tire of a vehicle etc. As the people in the modern world 
are very busy, they won’t be able to spend much time to find service providers to get these needs done and service providers may not be available 
whenever they are needed. Customers cannot get an idea about the time they would have to spend for a particular task. Although customers found a 
service provider there is no way for them to know whether this service provider is the most suitable one for the task and whether he is a skillful person.

It would be very helpful if people can have a real time solution for the problem of finding service providers. As it is more convenient to use web and 
mobile application it was proposed to create an application that directly integrates clients and service providers.
